# DataComm_ClassProject_DJ
This is a class project for data communications and networking. It is going to be an API to interact with Spotify and or iTunes that will act as the main DJ at a party, while anyone else connected on the same network can up vote, down vote, or add songs to the queue. The songs will be played in the order of most up voted first.
