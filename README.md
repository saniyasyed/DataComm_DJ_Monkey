# DataComm_ClassProject_DJ
This is a class project for data communications and networking. It is going to be an API to interact with 
Spotify and or iTunes that will act as the main DJ at a party, while anyone else connected on the same 
network can up vote, down vote, or add songs to the queue. The songs will be played in the order of 
most up voted first.
